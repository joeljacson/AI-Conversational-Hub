BAE 

Chat. Discover. Learn. Cook.

BAE is a next-generation AI conversational web application where the entire user experience lives inside a single intelligent chat interface.
There are no pages, tabs, side panels, popups, or modals.

👉 The chat is the product.

✨ What Makes BAE Different

Traditional apps use chat as a feature.
BAE flips this model.

No navigation

No screens

No UI fragmentation

One continuous, adaptive conversation

BAE understands intent, asks clarifying questions, and dynamically reshapes the conversation—without ever leaving the chat.

💬 Core Chat Behavior

Chat is the only interface

No page reloads

No screens

No dumping all information at once

AI always asks clarifying questions

User intent controls what is shown

Context persists until the user changes it

🪜 Chat Flow Rules (Inline Only)
1️⃣ Food Trigger

When the user types a food name
(e.g., Biryani, Pizza, Sushi, Idli–Sambar):

BAE responds with:

“Nice choice 😄 Which style are you looking for?”

Inline selectable chips appear, for example:

Hyderabadi

Ambur

Lucknowi

Kolkata
(or dish-specific variants)

2️⃣ Persistent Action Chips

After a style is selected, these chips always remain visible:

🍽️ Cuisine Info

🧾 Ingredients

📖 Full Recipe

⚡ Quick Version

They remain until the user changes the food.

3️⃣ Repeatable Actions (Core Ideology)

Clicking any chip:

Adds a new chat message

Does not remove existing chips

Users can switch actions repeatedly

Food + style context is always preserved

📋 Content Rules
Action	Output
Cuisine Info	Short description + region
Ingredients	Checklist-style message
Full Recipe	Step-by-step chat timeline
Quick Version	Compressed summary
🟥 Recipe as a Chat Timeline

Recipes are delivered as sequential chat messages, not pages.

Each step includes:

Time estimate

Short AI tip

Inline “Next step” button

No cards.
