Build a next-generation AI conversational web application named “BAE” (Brainy Assistant for Everything), where the entire user experience happens inside a single intelligent chat interface. There are no pages, tabs, side panels, popups, or modals. The chat itself is the UI and dynamically adapts based on user intent.

💬 CORE CHAT BEHAVIOR

Chat is the only UI

No page reloads, no screens

AI never dumps all information

AI asks clarifying questions

User intent controls what is shown

Context is preserved until the user changes food

🪜 CHAT FLOW RULES (INLINE ONLY)
1️⃣ Food Trigger

When the user enters a food name (e.g., Biryani, Pizza, Sushi, Idli–Sambar):

Respond with a chat message:

“Nice choice 😄 Which style are you looking for?”

Show inline selectable chips inside chat:

Example: Hyderabadi, Ambur, Lucknowi, Kolkata (or relevant styles)

2️⃣ Persistent Action Chips

After a style is selected, always show these inline action chips:

Cuisine Info

Ingredients

Full Recipe

Quick Version

These chips must remain visible until the user changes the food.

3️⃣ Repeatable Actions (CORE IDEOLOGY)

Clicking any action adds a new chat message

Do not remove the action chips

User can switch between actions again and again

Switching actions updates chat but keeps context

Food + style are preserved

📋 CONTENT RULES

Cuisine Info → short description + region

Ingredients → checklist-style chat message

Full Recipe → step-by-step chat messages

Quick Version → compressed recipe summary
